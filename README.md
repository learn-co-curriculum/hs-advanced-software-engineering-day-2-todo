Today, we'll be taking a deeper dive into Sinatra and forms, and learning about SQL, a brand new programming language for databases. For this morning's ToDo, go through the list below in order (it's okay if you don't finish everything)

1. Catch up on Fwitter from yesterday: check out today's Fwitter repository and use it as a guide. Think about the basic format of MVC. 

2. As our projects get more complex, we'll be spending a lot of time iterating through arrays - the Cartoon Collections lab is great practice for this. Try solving each test using the `.each` method, then see if you can solve it using more advanced Enumerable methods. The lab is test driven - run `learn` in your terminal and get all of the tests passing.
